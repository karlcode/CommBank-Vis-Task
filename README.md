##CommBank Data Visualisation Assignment

http://commbank-vis.surge.sh/

This is a charting project made in React for the Data Visualisation team at CommBank.

###Tools Used

I used React-Grid-Layout on the 

Underneath the visuals, I used Redux for passing state changes app wide via dispatched actions. 

###Thoughts

Although happy with how the project aesthetically looks, I am disappointed at not being able to implement several features in mind owing to time constraints. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
